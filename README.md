# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello and thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Mahya Ghazi Zadeh Hashemi, a Ph.D. candidate deeply immersed in the fascinating world of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, with a focus on agricultural applications. My journey in academia and research has been a blend of rigorous study, innovative project execution, and meaningful collaborations. 

### My PhD Research

Initiated in September 2021 under the mentorship of Dr. Narendra Das, my doctoral research focuses on crop classification, monitoring, and yield prediction utilizing SAR and AI techniques. A highlight of my work includes developing an analytical time series analysis algorithm in Python for estimating rice-paddy planting dates using Sentinel-1 data. This project enhanced the RHEAS framework for the NASA-SERVIR Project, integrating SAR-derived planting dates into the DSSAT crop model to improve rice yield estimation accuracy in Cambodia. This significant contribution was recognized and published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2022.

Moreover, my systematic literature review titled "Deep Learning and SAR in Agriculture" is under review at the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. This review not only synthesizes the latest advancements in the field but also reflects my deepened expertise in machine learning and deep learning, essential for advancing crop monitoring and yield estimation.

### Fieldwork and Collaborations

Addressing the scarcity of data in crop phenology and biophysical parameters estimation, I undertook field measurements in Michigan during the summers of 2022 and 2023. My involvement with the NISAR calibration-validation field campaign in summer 2024 in Michigan marks another step towards pioneering research in deep learning and SAR for yield estimation. My paper, under review in 'Computers and Electronics in Agriculture', introduces patch-based 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for estimating crop yield using SAR observations.

Currently, I am exploring Volumetric Water Content (VWC) estimation using machine learning techniques and foundational SAR backscatter models with Sentinel-1 and NISAR data. This work aims to refine VWC estimation methods and assess their impact on SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithms, potentially offering improvements over existing approaches.

### Looking Forward

My experiences and skills span across SAR data analysis, AI-driven agricultural monitoring, and land surface modeling. Although my primary research has not centered on land surface modeling, my academic coursework and projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in this area, particularly through the application of the CLM5 model.

I am on the lookout for collaborative opportunities that leverage my background in remote sensing, AI, and environmental modeling to make a tangible impact on global water and energy cycle research.

Thank you for exploring my GitHub profile. I am excited about the potential collaborations and projects that await and am keen to contribute to groundbreaking research that addresses the world's most pressing environmental challenges.
