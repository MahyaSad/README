# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello and thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Mahya Ghazi Zadeh Hashemi, a Ph.D. candidate deeply immersed in the fascinating world of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, with a focus on agricultural applications. My journey in academia and research has been a blend of rigorous study, innovative project execution, and meaningful collaborations. 

### My PhD Research

Initiated in September 2021, my doctoral research focuses on crop classification, monitoring, and yield prediction utilizing SAR and AI techniques. A highlight of my work includes developing an analytical time series analysis algorithm in Python for estimating rice-paddy planting dates using Sentinel-1 data. This project enhanced the RHEAS framework for the NASA-SERVIR Project, integrating SAR-derived planting dates into the DSSAT crop model to improve rice yield estimation accuracy in Cambodia. 
Moreover, my systematic literature review titled "Deep Learning and SAR in Agriculture" is under review at the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. This review not only synthesizes the latest advancements in the field but also reflects my deepened expertise in machine learning and deep learning, essential for advancing crop monitoring and yield estimation.

## Expertise in ML & DL for Agricultural Management

With a strong foundation in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), I've dedicated a significant portion of my research to applying these technologies in the realm of agricultural management. My goal has been to harness the power of ML and DL to address critical challenges in agriculture, such as yield prediction and Volumetric Water Content (VWC) estimation, thereby contributing to more sustainable and efficient farming practices.

### Review Paper on Deep Learning and SAR in Agriculture
My systematic literature review, titled "Deep Learning and SAR in Agriculture," currently under review, critically analyzes the latest advancements in applying SAR data with deep learning techniques for agricultural applications. This work underscores the potential of integrating SAR imagery with AI to revolutionize crop monitoring and management strategies.

### Yield Prediction Using SAR and AI Techniques
In a significant paper published in 2022, I explored the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) combined with AI methodologies for accurate crop yield prediction. This research introduced an analytical time series analysis algorithm for estimating rice-paddy planting dates, which was then integrated into the DSSAT crop model to improve rice yield estimation accuracy in Cambodia. This project exemplifies the practical application of DL in enhancing agricultural productivity and resource management.

### Pioneering VWC Estimation with Pre-trained Foundation Models
My ongoing work in Volumetric Water Content (VWC) estimation represents a cutting-edge approach in agricultural remote sensing. By pre-training a Vision Transformer (ViT) model with masked autoencoder, Dyno, and MoCo as self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, I'm setting the stage for a transformative leap in how we estimate and manage water content in vegetations. The fine-tuning of this pre-trained model for VWC estimation and yield prediction opens up new avenues for precision agriculture, enabling more accurate and timely decisions for water and crop management.

This endeavor not only highlights the innovative use of foundation models in agriculture but also demonstrates my commitment to advancing the field through the application of sophisticated ML and DL techniques. By continually pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI in agriculture, I aim to contribute to the development of more resilient and sustainable farming systems worldwide.

My work in leveraging ML and DL for agricultural management is a testament to the potential of these technologies to make significant impacts in real-world applications. I am excited about the future possibilities and committed to exploring new ways in which AI can contribute to the advancement of agricultural sciences.


### Fieldwork and Collaborations

Addressing the scarcity of data in crop phenology and biophysical parameters estimation, I undertook field measurements in Michigan during the summers of 2022 and 2023. My involvement with the NISAR calibration-validation field campaign in summer 2024 in Michigan marks another step towards pioneering research in deep learning and SAR for yield estimation. 


### Looking Forward

I am on the lookout for collaborative opportunities that leverage my background in remote sensing, AI, and environmental modeling to make a tangible impact on global water and energy cycle research.

Thank you for exploring my GitHub profile. I am excited about the potential collaborations and projects that await and am keen to contribute to groundbreaking research that addresses the world's most pressing environmental challenges.
